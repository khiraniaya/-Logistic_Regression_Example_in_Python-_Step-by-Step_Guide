# Logistic_Regression_Example_in_Python-_Step-by-Step_Guide

In this guide, we’ll show a logistic regression example in Python, step-by-step.

Logistic regression is a popular machine learning algorithm for supervised learning – classification problems. In a previous tutorial, we explained the logistic regression model and its related concepts. Following this tutorial, you’ll see the full process of applying it with Python sklearn, including:
- How to explore, clean, and transform the data.
- How to split into training and test datasets.
- How to fit, evaluate, and interpret the model.

If you want to apply logistic regression in your next ML Python project, you’ll love this practical, real-world example
